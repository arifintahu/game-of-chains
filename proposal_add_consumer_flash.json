    "title": "Create the ⚡️FLASH⚡️ chain",
    "description": "This is the proposal to create the consumer chain `flash`. Flash uses a forked version of the Cosmos SDK [Flash SDK](https://github.com/clemensgg/flash-sdk) with updated default consensus timeout parameters, to allow a **target block production rate of ~1.7s / block**. We'll use this chain to test eventual issues with relayer performance due to diverging block times.
